  "ownerUpgrades": "Recent enhancements to the stronghold ensure it remains fit for both winter siege and summer court. A newly installed HVAC system (2023) channels warmth through the stone corridors like dragonfire through Valyrian steel — silent, efficient, and unrelenting. The energy-efficient windows, forged to withstand both storm and scrutiny, now flood the chambers with daylight fit for a Hand of the King. Meanwhile, the kitchens have been tastefully remodeled with quartz countertops — smooth as the marble of Oldtown and durable enough to survive both feast and famine. As Tyrion Lannister might say, 'One needn’t choose between comfort and conquest when one can afford both.'",

    "description": "Each level of Casterly Rock is a testament to ancient craftsmanship and modern adaptability. The main hall features a grand throne chamber with adjoining council rooms and banquet space, ideal for entertaining bannermen or hosting high feasts. Private family quarters are nestled into the upper spires, offering panoramic sea views and secured inner sanctums. Below, the lower levels include servant wings, a robust armory, and access to the treasury vaults and lion-carved war tunnels. From hidden passageways to sunlit terraces above Lannisport, every square foot balances opulence with fortified utility.",
